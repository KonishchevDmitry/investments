# Configures benchmarks for portfolio backtesting according to the following rules:
# * At this time only MOEX and LSE exchanges are available. LSE historical quotes are available only when Alpha Vantage
#   API key is specified (quotes.alphavantage.api_key setting). T-Bank API (brokers.tbank.api_token setting) is highly
#   recommended for MOEX historical quotes, because MOEX API is buggy.
# * It's assumed that accumulating ETF are used for benchmarks (because historical quotes don't provide dividend history).
# * Each benchmark may be marked with provider info which allows to track performance of single index using different
#   ETF providers (and split the results using provider label in metrics).
# * Each benchmark may transition from one ETF to another during its life. For example, you want to track performance of
#   SBMX, TMOS and EQMX ETF (Russian stocks), but your portfolio has been created when these ETF weren't available yet.
#   In this case you select the closest analog (FXRL ETF), which will be used until some point of time, selected by you
#   (typically some day with low volatility) at which backtesting logic sell all your FXRL and buy SBMX/TMOS/EQMX.
#
# Historical API handle instrument renames differently:
# * With MOEX API you need to request quotes for different symbols depending on the period.
# * T-Bank API forgets all previous instrument symbols and returns all quotes by its current symbol.
# `aliases` field helps to write search rules which will work with both provider types.
